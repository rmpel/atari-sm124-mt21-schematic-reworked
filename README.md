# Atari SM124 schematic (MT-21) 1986 - Reworked
The schematic available on the web is terribly bad in readability. This is a reworked schematic with all references legible.

## Sources: 

1. [SM124 Service Manual on Archive.org](https://archive.org/details/SM124_Service_Manual_MT-21)
1. [Annotated MT-21 Schematic on Archive.org](https://archive.org/details/Atari_SM124_Schematic_1986_Atari/page/n5/mode/2up)

## In this repository, you will find;

1. A reworked schematic; all references are validated against the BOM in the Service Manual,
1. A retyped BOM in Numbers, Excel and CSV formats, the Numbers file is the source for the Excel and CSV files,
1. A list of errata and notes for the discrepancies I found, and it includes the upgrades listed by N.S. Lee in 1987,
1. A PDF of the result which, luckily, seems to be searchable (at least on a Mac in Preview).

## Todo/Wishlist

I would love to redraw the entire schematic, but I doubt Photoshop (PhotoPea) is the tool for that and my skills in KiCad are non-existant.
If you have the skills and time, and know your way around in KiCad, please feel free to add.

## Thanks

* Thanks to N.S. Lee for providing the schematic with notes in 1987,
* Thanks to Atari for making the service manual and schematics available in the first place.

## My request to you

If you found this helpful in any way, just leave a note :). If you find I made a mistake, please let me know. Either can be done using the Issues tab.

(Now let's see if I can repair my non-functioning SM124 ...)
